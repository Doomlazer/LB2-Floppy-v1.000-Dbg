## The Colonel's Bequest (LB1 DOS-1.000.046) 

Base decompile: https://github.com/sluicebox/sci-scripts/tree/main/cb-dos-1.000.046

The DOS, Atari and Amiga versions of The Colonel's Bequest seem to have not included two scripts, SortCopy & Sight. The missing scripts were ported from https://github.com/EricOakford/SCI-Decompilation-Archive/tree/master/lb1

Compiles without errors or warnings, but has not been thoroughly tested.
